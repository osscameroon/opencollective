### Billing

osscameroon provides few services that require a billing system.
We use [opencollective](https://opencollective.com) to process billing.
People/companies that use this paid services are billed through opencollective.

The billing api will provide osscameroon applications a way to verify that a user has paid for a service through opencollective.
